# RiskBiasDetector

This project focuses on the development of an AI-powered tool that helps identify biases and ethical issues within decision-making processes in AI systems used for cybersecurity. The tool automates the audit of AI systems by analyzing system logs to detect any unfair or discriminatory decisions made by AI models, with a focus on improving fairness and transparency in automated security operations.

## Key Features

- **Bias Detection**: Automatically detects biases in AI decisions based on user characteristics such as location, device, time of login, etc.
- **Fairness Assessment**: Analyzes whether AI models treat different groups of users equally and fairly, ensuring decisions are not discriminatory.
- **Risk Prediction**: Identifies potential security risks based on user behavior and environmental factors.
- **Report Generation**: Generates detailed reports that highlight potential ethical issues, biases, and recommendations for improvement.
- **Data Visualization**: Presents results in easy-to-understand visualizations such as graphs, heat maps, and charts.
- **Interactive Interface**: Provides an intuitive web interface for users to adjust analysis parameters, view results, and interact with the data.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: 
  - **Open AI**: For implementing machine learning models and algorithms.
  - **Fairlearn**: For fairness analysis and mitigation of bias in AI models.
  - **AIF360**: IBM's AI Fairness 360 toolkit for detecting and mitigating bias.
- **Data Visualization**:
  - **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**: For generating various charts and graphs.
  - **Plotly**: For interactive visualizations and dashboards.
- **Web Framework**: Streamlit / Gradio (for building an interactive web interface).

## How It Works

The RBD Tool processes security system logs and applies machine learning models to identify and mitigate biases in AI-based decision-making. The main steps include:

1. **Data Collection**: Security logs are processed and cleaned to remove inconsistencies.
2. **Bias Detection**: Machine learning models analyze the logs to detect if certain groups (e.g., users from specific regions or demographics) are unfairly treated.
3. **Fairness Assessment**: The tool evaluates whether the decisions made by AI models are equal for all user groups.
4. **Reporting**: Based on the analysis, a comprehensive report is generated highlighting any biases, issues with fairness, and recommendations to improve the ethical standards of the AI models.
5. **Visualization**: The results are displayed with visualizations to provide clear insights into the analysis.
